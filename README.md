# Liftable Pallets and Bales

All base game pallets, big bags, and bales are now liftable by hand, weighing only 100 kg.

Productions/animal pens will spawn these lightweight pallets after installing this mod. Anything existing before activation will remain original weight.
All pallets are available for purchase on the warehouse/pallet store on your map.
Bales and pallets brought through this mod are compatible with (console)autoloaders.

Included are balers and cotton harvesters producing bales weighing only 100 kg, making them liftable by hand! Produced bales can be wrapped and transported by all base game equipment.
Liftable grass/silage/hay/straw bales in all sizes available for purchase through the shop.

This mod will not make pallets, big bags, or bales added by other mods liftable, unless mentioned by this mod.
